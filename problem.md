# Traffic Flow Analysis and Optimization

## Problem Statement
Traffic data reveals a significant imbalance in vehicle distribution across different routes during peak hours. The majority of traffic is concentrated on **Windsor_South**, while **Cunard_East** and **Chebucto_West** experience significantly lower vehicle counts. This leads to congestion and slower movement on Windsor_South, while other routes remain underutilized.

## Observations
| Route            | 7:00-7:15 | 7:15-7:30 | 7:30-7:45 | 7:45-8:00 | 8:00-8:15 |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Windsor_South  | 40        | 48        | 68        | 67        | 90        |
| Cunard_East    | 17        | 14        | 23        | 12        | -         |
| Chebucto_West  | 1         | 1         | 2         | 0         | -         |

- **Windsor_South** sees an increasing number of vehicles over time, peaking at 90 between 8:00-8:15.
- **Cunard_East** and **Chebucto_West** consistently have lower vehicle counts, leading to underutilized road capacity.
- The imbalance suggests that alternative routes are not effectively distributing traffic flow.

## Identified Issues
1. **Traffic Congestion on Windsor_South**
   - High vehicle concentration results in slower movement and increased travel time.
   - Bottlenecks at intersections and merging points.

2. **Underutilization of Cunard_East and Chebucto_West**
   - Inefficient use of available road infrastructure.
   - Opportunity to redistribute traffic and ease congestion on Windsor_South.

3. **Possible Cause**.
   - Inefficient traffic signal management and road design.

# My Proposed Windsor-Chebucto-Cunard Roundabout Solution

## Overview
This solution implements an innovative double-teardrop roundabout design to optimize traffic flow at the intersection of Windsor Street, Chebucto Road, and Cunard Street. The solution specifically addresses the traffic imbalance where Windsor_South experiences heavy congestion while Cunard_East and Chebucto_West remain underutilized.

## Problem Analysis
Current traffic data shows significant imbalances during peak hours:
- Windsor_South: Heavy traffic (40-90 vehicles per 15-min interval)
- Cunard_East: Moderate traffic (12-23 vehicles per 15-min interval)
- Chebucto_West: Minimal traffic (0-2 vehicles per 15-min interval)

## Solution Design
### Key Features
1. Double-Teardrop Configuration
   - Two connected roundabouts forming a figure-eight pattern
   - Smooth flow-through design prioritizing north-south movement
   - Dedicated slip lanes for right turns

2. Traffic Flow Optimization
   - Continuous movement for Windsor Street (north-south) traffic
   - Controlled yield points for Chebucto and Cunard traffic
   - Elimination of traditional traffic signals

3. Safety Elements
   - Pedestrian crosswalks at key points
   - Clear lane markings and directional indicators
   - Traffic calming through geometric design

## Benefits
1. **Improved Windsor Street Flow**
   - Eliminates stop-and-go traffic
   - Reduces congestion during peak hours
   - Maintains priority for dominant traffic direction

2. **Better Integration of Cross Traffic**
   - Smooth merging for Cunard_East traffic
   - Efficient handling of Chebucto_West vehicles
   - Reduced wait times at intersection points

3. **Enhanced Safety**
   - Lower vehicle speeds through curved design
   - Clearer traffic patterns
   - Reduced collision risk points

## Implementation Considerations
1. Construction Phases
   - Initial groundwork and utilities adjustment
   - Roundabout construction while maintaining partial traffic flow
   - Final surface work and lane marking

2. Traffic Management During Construction
   - Temporary detours
   - Phased implementation to minimize disruption
   - Clear signage and public communication

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Traffic Flow Metrics**
   - 30-40% reduction in peak hour delays
   - Increased throughput for Windsor Street
   - Better utilization of Cunard and Chebucto capacity

2. **Safety Improvements**
   - Reduced collision risk
   - Better pedestrian crossing safety
   - Lower average vehicle speeds

## Future Monitoring
1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Traffic count comparisons
   - Travel time studies
   - Accident rate monitoring

2. **Adjustment Capabilities**
   - Lane marking modifications if needed
   - Signage optimization
   - Response to usage patterns
