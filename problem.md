# Traffic Flow Analysis and Optimization

## Problem Statement
Traffic data reveals a significant imbalance in vehicle distribution across different routes during peak hours. The majority of traffic is concentrated on **Windsor_South**, while **Cunard_East** and **Chebucto_West** experience significantly lower vehicle counts. This leads to congestion and slower movement on Windsor_South, while other routes remain underutilized.

## Observations
| Route            | 7:00-7:15 | 7:15-7:30 | 7:30-7:45 | 7:45-8:00 | 8:00-8:15 |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Windsor_South  | 40        | 48        | 68        | 67        | 90        |
| Cunard_East    | 17        | 14        | 23        | 12        | -         |
| Chebucto_West  | 1         | 1         | 2         | 0         | -         |

- **Windsor_South** sees an increasing number of vehicles over time, peaking at 90 between 8:00-8:15.
- **Cunard_East** and **Chebucto_West** consistently have lower vehicle counts, leading to underutilized road capacity.
- The imbalance suggests that alternative routes are not effectively distributing traffic flow.

## Identified Issues
1. **Traffic Congestion on Windsor_South**
   - High vehicle concentration results in slower movement and increased travel time.
   - Bottlenecks at intersections and merging points.

2. **Underutilization of Cunard_East and Chebucto_West**
   - Inefficient use of available road infrastructure.
   - Opportunity to redistribute traffic and ease congestion on Windsor_South.

3. **Possible Cause**.
   - Inefficient traffic signal management and road design.

## Proposed Solutions
1. **Traffic Diversion Strategies**
   - My proposal is to create this roundabout that will reduce the west and east traffic effect on southern traffic.
